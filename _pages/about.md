I am Yorgos, a Physicist and Software Developer. 

Currently working in the field of Quantum Computing and in particular in Quantum Error Correction.

I hold an MSc in Applied Physics from TU Delft (Quantum Devices and Quantum Computing track) and a BSc in Physics from the University of Patras.

At Entropica Labs, I am a core developer of [Loom](https://github.com/EntropicaLabs/el-loom), an open-source Python library for quantum error correction research.

I enjoy building software in collaborative environments, and I am particularly passionate about impactful open-source projects.

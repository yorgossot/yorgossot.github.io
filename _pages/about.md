I am Yorgos, a soon-to-be graduate of the Applied Physics Masters at TU Delft, in the track of Physics for Quantum Devices and Quantum Computing.

I am a Quantum Computing enthusiast and my main focus is Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerance.
Additionally, I have delved into the subjects of Quantum Optics and Simulation of Quantum Systems.
Throughout all of my projects, I have honed my coding skills in Python, Q#, and relevant quantum libraries. 

Born and raised in Greece with a passion for meeting new people and experiencing new cultures.
Primarily, I enjoy looking at the ceiling recreationally and watching the silliest videos possible on YouTube.
In the rest of my free time, I like cycling, working-out and cooking with friends.

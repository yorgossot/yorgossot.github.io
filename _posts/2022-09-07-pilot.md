The primary reason why I am creating this blog, and consequently this post, is because I could not avoid it.
Do not misunderstand me please; this is not the result of peer pressure or some inner, unresolved need to express myself.
Actually, it might be a bit of both of the above, but most importantly, it is the result of my inability to get rid of the blog page from [this magnificent webpage template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) I recently adopted for my website. 

Thus, my dear reader -who coincidentally might be me most of the times- this blogging experience begins.
As you may have already noticed, I say nothing.
I mean, I do say something, but the amount of information you are getting is pretty much zero because I am just elaborating on the very trivial fact that I am starting to blog.
This observation may be interesting but it is trivial in itself as well.

To conclude, expect the next of my posts to also contain this silly attempt of prose, which although I seem to be doing it down in a failed attempt to be humble, I actually enjoy it a lot. 
Writing it, at least.
Reading my blog will be a waste of time, but what isn't? 
Pardon me, it is quite late...
